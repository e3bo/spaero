## Overview

`spaero` is being developed to support the work of researchers working
on [Project AERO](https://daphnia.ecology.uga.edu/midas/). `spaero` is
publicly available in part to disseminate and increase the
reproducibility of the project's research and in part because it may
be useful to others.

## Installation

The stable version of `spaero` that is on CRAN may be installed from
within R:

```r
install.packages("spaero")
```

Alternatively, the development version that is on GitHub may be
installed using the `devtools` package:

```r
devtools::install_github("e3bo/spaero")
```

## Documentation

After installation, a listing of the available documentation can be obtained:

```r
help(package = "spaero")
```

## Contributions

Please use GitHub issues or pull requests to let us know about any
bugs you find.

Feature requests are also welcome but be forewarned that we have
limited time to work on items not directly supporting the project's
research.

More details about contribution may be found in the
[contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).
