	abstract = {Anticipating infectious disease emergence and documenting progress in disease elimination are important applications for the theory of critical transitions. A key problem is the development of theory relating the dynamical processes of transmission to observable phenomena. In this paper, we consider compartmental susceptible–infectious–susceptible (SIS) and susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) models that are slowly forced through a critical transition. We derive expressions for the behavior of several candidate indicators, including the autocorrelation coefficient, variance, coefficient of variation, and power spectra of SIS and SIR epidemics during the approach to emergence or elimination. We validated these expressions using individual-based simulations. We further showed that moving-window estimates of these quantities may be used for anticipating critical transitions in infectious disease systems. Although leading indicators of elimination were highly predictive, we found the approach to emergence to be much more difficult to detect. It is hoped that these results, which show the anticipation of critical transitions in infectious disease systems to be theoretically possible, may be used to guide the construction of online algorithms for processing surveillance data.},

	abstract = {We analyze the structure of stochastic dynamics near either a stable or unstable fixed point, where the force can be approximated by linearization. We find that a cost function that determines a Boltzmann-like stationary distribution can always be defined near it. Such a stationary distribution does not need to satisfy the usual detailed balance condition but might have instead a divergence-free probability current. In the linear case, the force can be split into two parts, one of which gives detailed balance with the diffusive motion, whereas the other induces cyclic motion on surfaces of constant cost function. By using the Jordan transformation for the force matrix, we find an explicit construction of the cost function. We discuss singularities of the transformation and their consequences for the stationary distribution. This Boltzmann-like distribution may be not unique, and nonlinear effects and boundary conditions may change the distribution and induce additional currents even in the neighborhood of a fixed point.},

	abstract = {Many dynamical systems, including lakes, organisms, ocean circulation patterns, or financial markets, are now thought to have tipping points where critical transitions to a contrasting state can happen. Because critical transitions can occur unexpectedly and are difficult to manage, there is a need for methods that can be used to identify when a critical transition is approaching. Recent theory shows that we can identify the proximity of a system to a critical transition using a variety of so-called ‘early warning signals’, and successful empirical examples suggest a potential for practical applicability. However, while the range of proposed methods for predicting critical transitions is rapidly expanding, opinions on their practical use differ widely, and there is no comparative study that tests the limitations of the different methods to identify approaching critical transitions using time-series data. Here, we summarize a range of currently available early warning methods and apply them to two simulated time series that are typical of systems undergoing a critical transition. In addition to a methodological guide, our work offers a practical toolbox that may be used in a wide range of fields to help detect early warning signals of critical transitions in time series data.},
