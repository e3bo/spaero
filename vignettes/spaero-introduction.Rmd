The spaero package (pronounced sparrow) currently supports the
estimation of distributional properties along rolling windows of time
series. Such estimates may in some cases provide signals that the
system generating the data is approaching a critical
transition. Examples of critical transitions include the
eutrophication of lakes, changes in climate, and the emergence or
eradication of infectious diseases. The spearo package will be
developed to further support statistical methods to anticipate
critical transitions in infectious disease systems. Because these
methods will be based on generic properties of dynamical systems, they
have the potential to apply to a broad range of models.  spearo also
provides functions to support computational experiments designed to
evaluate these methods for applications relevant to infectious disease
systems. This document provides a rudimentary demonstration of the
application of such methods to simulated data.

Our simulated data is a time series produced by a stochastic SIR
simulator included in the spaero package. See @keeling2008 for an
introduction to the SIR model. The simulator is capable of including
time dependent parameters. Gillespie's direct method is used to update
the model variables during the simulation. Transitions between states
occurs according to the rules given in Table~\ref{trules}, which makes
use of the symbols defined in Table~\ref{tsymb}. Because some of the
transition rates may change continuously with time and because the
simulation algorithm updates the rates only at points of time when the
model's state variables are updated, these simulations are not in
general exact. However, for many realistic scenarios birth and death
updates occur frequently enough that the simulation should be highly
accurate. Also, in newer versions of pomp (versions >= 1.13.4), the
``hmax'' parameter of pomp's \texttt{simulate} method can be used to
set the maximum simulation time that can elapse before an update of
the reaction rates.

\begin{table}[h] \caption{Transition rules for our stochastic SIR model}
\label{trules}
\begin{tabular}{lll} \hline{Event}&{($\Delta S,\Delta I, \Delta R$)}&{Rate}\\
\hline birth of a susceptible & $(1,0,0)$ & $ N_0 (\mu + \mu_t) [1 - (p + pt_t)] $\\

Before demonstrating the statistical analysis functions of spearo, we
provide an overview of the simulation functions. These functions
essentially provide a convenient interface to the general simulation
capabilities of the pomp package. The user calls the
\texttt{create\_simulator} function to create an object of class \texttt{pomp}. This
object contains the model structure as well as default parameters for
the simulation. Simulations of the model may then be run using the
\texttt{simulate} method in the pomp package:
```{r}
library(spaero)
sim <- create_simulator()
simout <- pomp::simulate(sim)
```

This code creates a new pomp object and runs a simulation with the
default parameters. The variable simout contains a second pomp object
that contains the simulation results. These results may be extracted
like so:
```{r}
as(simout, "data.frame")
```
Note that the covariates (i.e., the time-dependent components of the
parameters) are included in addition to the state variables and
observables. Also, $\beta_t$ in Table~\ref{tsymb} is named with the
string "beta_par_t" and not "beta_t". Similarly, the parameter $\beta$
is named "beta_par". This name was chosen because "beta" cannot be
used in the C code defining the simulator due to conflicts with the
name of the beta function.

Alternatively, one can run the simulator like this to output the
results as a data frame.
```[r]
simout <- pomp::simulate(sim, as.data.frame=TRUE)
```

In addition to simulating the dynamics of disease spread, the pomp
object also simulates imperfect observation of the dynamics. A cases
variable is included in the output and it counts the total number of
recoveries that occurred in the preceding interval between
observations. A corresponding number of reports is simulated by
sampling from a binomial probability mass function with a number of
trials equal to the number of cases and a reporting probability equal
to a user-supplied parameter, $\rho$.

Observation times and parameters can be set at simulation run time:
```{r}
pars <- sim@params
pars["rho"] <- 0.5
pomp::simulate(sim, params=pars, times=seq(1, 4), as.data.frame=TRUE)
```
However, the covariate table that determines the time dependence of
rates cannot be set at simulation time.

One can also set the number of replicates.
```{r}
pomp::simulate(sim, nsim=2, times=seq(1, 2), as.data.frame=TRUE)
```

The random number seed allows simulations to be reproduced.
```{r}
pomp::simulate(sim, seed=342, as.data.frame=TRUE)
pomp::simulate(sim, seed=342, as.data.frame=TRUE)
```

An SIS model is also available. This model is identical to the SIR
model except that the recovery event in Table~\ref{trules} results in an
infective individual becoming a susceptible.
```{r}
sim_sis <- create_simulator(process_model="SIS")
pomp::simulate(sim_sis, as.data.frame=TRUE)
```

Now let's simulate data according to the SIR model where the
transmission rate starts out well below the threshold value and
gradually increases. Note that parameters corresponding to the initial
conditions (i.e., $S_0$, $I_0$, and $R_0$) are
normalized to sum to $N_0$. Thus we can specify that the
simulation begins with a population of 100,000 susceptibles as
follows.

```{r}

params <- c(gamma=24, mu=0.014, d=0.014, eta=1e-4, beta_par=0,
            rho=0.9, S_0=1, I_0=0, R_0=0, N_0=1e5, p=0)
covar <- data.frame(gamma_t=c(0, 0), mu_t=c(0, 0), d_t=c(0, 0), eta_t=c(0, 0),
                    beta_par_t=c(0, 24e-5), p_t = c(0, 0), time=c(0, 300))
times <- seq(0, 200, by=1/12)

sim <- create_simulator(params=params, times=times, covar=covar)
so <- pomp::simulate(sim, as.data.frame=TRUE, seed=272)
plot(ts(so[, "reports"], freq=12), ylab="No. reports")

```

By eye, we can see the distribution of reports seems to change over
time. We can summarize these changes by computing statistics over
moving windows.

```{r}

st1 <- get_stats(so[, "reports"], center_kernel="uniform",
                 center_trend="local_constant", center_bandwidth=360,
                 stat_bandwidth=360)
plot_st <- function(st) {
  plot_vars <- ts(cbind(Residual=st$centered$x[, 1], Mean=st$stats$mean,
                  Autocorrelation=st$stats$autocor, Variance=st$stats$variance,
                  DeltaVariance=st$stats$variance_first_diff,
                  Skewness=st$stats$skew), freq=12)
  plot(plot_vars, main="")
}
plot_st(st1)

```

The increasing trends in the statistics are potential warning
signals that the system is approaching the epidemic threshold. Readers
interested in this type of analysis can find guidelines in
@dakos_methods_2012 and may also want to consider performing it with
the \texttt{generic\_ews} function in the earlywarnings package
described in that paper. We'll next review the input parameters and
implementation of \texttt{get\_stats}.

Two key parameters that the user must provide to \texttt{get\_stats}
are the shape and size of the rolling window. There is a rolling
window for an estimate of the mean and for an estimate of moments
within the window. Arguments controlling these windows are prefixed
with "center_" and "stat_" respectively. An estimate of the mean is
necessary because the calculations of the statistics involve
deviations from the mean. \texttt{get\_stats} supports estimation of
the mean via several methods and users may also estimate the mean
using other methods, subtract it from the input time series, and then
set the "center_trend" argument to "assume_zero". Regarding the shapes
of windows, a rectangular window function and a Gaussian-shaped
function are available by providing either "uniform" or "gaussian" to
the kernel arguments. The rectangular function may be preferred for
ease of interpretation while the Gaussian function may be preferred
for obtaining a smoother series of estimates. The width of the window
is controlled by the bandwidth arguments. For a window centered on a
particular index, the absolute difference between that index and all
other indices in the time series is divided by the bandwidth to
determine a distance to all other observations. This distance is then
plugged into a kernel function corresponding to the window type. For
the gaussian window, the kernel function is a Gaussian probability
density function with a standard deviation of one. For the rectangular
window, the kernel function equals one if the distance is less than
one and zero otherwise. The "backward_only" argument determines
whether the rectangular window is backward-looking by controlling
whether the kernel function is forced to zero for any indices greater
than the window's index. In other words, "backward_only = TRUE" makes
the rectangular window right-aligned instead of centered. The output
of the kernel function is a weight for each observation. These weights
are used in the estimators described next. Note that these bandwidth
conventions are different from those of \texttt{generic\_ews}. Note
also that only when "backward_only = TRUE" does the bandwidth
correspond directly to the size of a moving window.

By default, \texttt{get\_stats} computes statistics via weighted
sample moments. To clarify, the estimate of the moment for the moving
window centered on index $i$ of the time series $x$ is
\begin{equation} m_i(f_j(x)) = \sum_j w_{ij} f_j(x) / N_i,
\end{equation} where $w_{ij}$ is a kernel weight, $f_j(x)$ is the
value of the moment at index $j$, and $N_i = \sum_j w_{ij}$ is a
normalization constant. Table~\ref{tstats} provides the formulas for
the statistics computed in terms of these moment estimates.  In some
cases, users may obtain less biased estimates by setting the
"stat_trend" argument to "local_linear". This replaces the weighted
average estimate with a prediction from a local linear
regression. This method can reduce bias near the ends of the time
series if a trend exists such that $f_j(x)$ for $j$ near $i$ tend to
be above or below the expected value of $f_i(x)$ across repeated
realizations of a time series. If the prediction is less than zero for
variance or kurtosis, it is replaced with zero.

\begin{table}[h] \caption{Formulas for moving window statistics in terms of moment estimates.}  \label{tstats}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\hline
Statistic & Formula\\
\hline
$\textrm{mean}_i$ & $m_i(x_j)$ \\
$\textrm{variance}_i$ & $m_i((x_j - \textrm{mean}_j)^2)$ \\
$\textrm{variance\_first\_diff}_i$ & $\textrm{variance}_i - \textrm{variance}_{i - 1}$ \\
$\textrm{autocovariance}_i$ & $m_i( (x_j - \textrm{mean}_j)
                                  (x_{j - \textrm{lag}} - \textrm{mean}_{j -\textrm{lag}}))$ \\
$\textrm{autocorrelation}_i$ & $\textrm{autocovariance}_i /
                                (\textrm{variance}_i \times
                                \textrm{variance}_{i - \textrm{lag}})^{0.5} $ \\
$(\textrm{decay time})_i$ & $-\textrm{lag} / (\log \min(\max(\textrm{autocorrelation}_i, 0), 1)$) \\
$(\textrm{index of dispersion})_i$ & $\textrm{variance}_i / \textrm{mean}_i$ \\
$(\textrm{coefficient of variation})_i$ & $(\textrm{variance}_i)^{0.5} / \textrm{mean}_i$ \\
$\textrm{skewness}_i$ & $m_i((x_j - \textrm{mean}_j)^3) / (\textrm{variance}_i)^{1.5}$ \\
$\textrm{kurtosis}_i$ & $m_i((x_j - \textrm{mean}_j)^4) / (\textrm{variance}_i)^2$ \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Let's look at the effect of changing some of these parameters on the
computed statistics.  First we try a Gaussian window.

```{r}

st2 <- get_stats(so[, "reports"], center_kernel="gaussian",
                 center_trend="local_constant", center_bandwidth=360,
                 stat_bandwidth=360, stat_kernel="gaussian")
plot_st(st2)


```

Next, we'll increase the bandwidths.
```{r}

st3 <- get_stats(so[, "reports"], center_kernel="gaussian",
                 center_trend="local_constant", center_bandwidth=720,
                 stat_bandwidth=720, stat_kernel="gaussian")
plot_st(st3)

```

That concludes our initial overview of the package. The current
version of spaero is just a starting point and the package will
continue to be actively developed for the foreseeable future.
